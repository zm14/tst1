## About

A Rasperry Pi has an spi interface. So why don't connect directly an rf24 device?

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "RPi MySensor Gateway" add-on.
1. Start the "RPi MySensor Gateway" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "RPi MySensor Gateway" add-on to see if everything went well.

<!---
1. Default login information is admin@admin.com/password.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
    "rebuild": false,  
    "log_level": "debug",  
    "channel":75,
    "pa_level":"RF24_PA_MAX",
    "ce_pin":22,
    "cs_pin":24,
    "use_irq":{
        "rx_buffer":20,
        "pin":15
    },
    "use_led":{
        "err_pin": 12,
        "rx_pin": 16,
        "tx_pin": 11
    }
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

**Info**: _For detailed specifications go on [MySensors pages][mysensors]_

### Option: `rebuild`

Force the MySensor build to clean all **ONLY FOR TEST**
Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

debug,info,notice,warn,err

- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `notice`: Normal (low verbose) interesting events.
- `warn`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `err`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.


### Option: `channel`

<0-125>   RF channel for the sensor net. [75]

### Option: `pa_level`

### Option: `ce_pin`

Pin number to use for rf24 Chip-Enable.

### Option: `cs_pin`

Pin number to use for rf24 Chip-Select.

### Option: `use_irq`

Only applies if external irg pin is connected.

#### Option: `use_irq.rx_buffer`

Buffer size for incoming messages when using rf24 interrupts. [20]

#### Option: `use_irq.pin`

Pin number connected to nRF24L01P IRQ pin.

### Option: `use_led`

Only applies if led are conneted.

#### Option: `use_led.err_pin`

Error LED pin.

#### Option: `use_led.rx_pin`

Receive LED pin.

#### Option: `use_led.tx_pin`
